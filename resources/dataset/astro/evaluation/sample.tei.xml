		<p>Based on observations collected with ATCA under <rs type="astro-object">ID C2718</rs>, and at VLA under <rs type="astro-object">ID 13B-017</rs>.</p>

		<p>GRB hosts of our sample have an extent smaller than about 1 arcsec; the exceptions are <rs type="astro-object">GRBs 020819B</rs>, <rs type="astro-object">050219</rs>, <rs type="astro-object">080319C</rs>, and <rs type="astro-object">110918A</rs> (see below). With ATCA, we observed our sample sources (project C2718; PI: J. Greiner) with the CFB 1M-0.5K mode in the 6 km configuration, providing 2048 channels per 2048 MHz continuum IF (1 MHz resolution) and 2048 channels per 1 MHz zoom band (0.5 kHz resolution). Most sources were observed over the full range of hour angles to ensure good uv-plane coverage.</p>

		<p>We detect only one of our targets, the nearest one, namely <rs type="astro-object">GRB 020819B</rs> with a measured flux F(3 GHz) = 31 ± 8 μJy. The peak of the radio emission is at RA (2000.0) = 23:27:19.50, Dec (2000) = +06:15:55.8 with an error of 0 . 3.</p>

		<p><rs type="astro-object">GRB 050219</rs> was not among the originally proposed targets (neither the SFR nor mass was known at the time of observation), but was observed as an ATCA filler target in otherwise not usable gaps. </p>
