We detect GRB 020819B at 4σ at 3 GHz, at about 11 yr after the burst. We argue that a good fraction of this emission, if not all, is due to afterglow emission, thus adding GRB 020819B to the group of GRBs with very long-lasting detected radio afterglows, where GRB 030329 is the most prominent example (van der Horst et al. 2008). In a similar case, GRB 980425, with a radio-bright knot at the GRB position, an afterglow interpretation has been excluded (Michałowski et al. 2014).
