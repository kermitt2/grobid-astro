GRB 050219 was not among the originally proposed targets (neither the SFR nor mass was known at the time of observation), but was observed as an ATCA filler target in otherwise not usable gaps. It is thus listed separately at the end of Table 1, which lists the details of all our 12 observed sources.

We detect GRB 020819B at 4σ at 3 GHz, at about 11 yr after the burst. We argue that a good fraction of this emission, if not all, is due to afterglow emission, thus adding GRB 020819B to the group of GRBs with very long-lasting detected radio afterglows, where GRB 030329 is the most prominent example (van der Horst et al. 2008). In a similar case, GRB 980425, with a radio-bright knot at the GRB position, an afterglow interpretation has been excluded (Michałowski et al. 2014).
